NtInvalidateFileCache

This is a small tool that lets you invalidate the file cache on NT. Might be
usefull when doing performance testing. This tool instructs NT to empty the
standby list, which effectively invalidates all file buffers by the Cache
Manager.

Inspired by the menu option Empty > Empty Standby List of Mark Russinovich's
RAMMap tool [1]. Code is heavily derived from ASSP's [2] FileSystemCache.cs [3].
